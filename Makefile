# from src/terminal.cpp only in how the console is put into raw mode. The

# ---- what RIDE drives, and the confirmation that it is there -------------
#
# The editor links against none of these. It *runs* them, and it finds them
# beside itself - path::besideProgram, asked before PATH, so that a compiler
# shipped with this copy is the one this copy runs. Which means "built" and
# "usable" are two different states, and until now nothing checked the second.
#
# That gap is not hypothetical: a bin/ was assembled holding shc.exe without
# the runtime archives shc links, and every build stayed green and every suite
# passed, because a suite that cannot find a compiler skips its cases and says
# so quietly. The failure waited for somebody to open a Shalimar file and press
# Run, and then read as a broken compiler rather than an incomplete directory.
#
# Both archives are named, not only the release one. Debug is the editor's
# default configuration and links the other file, so checking one of the two
# would confirm exactly the half that was not about to be used.
# c2s is here for the same reason the two compilers are: the editor runs it
# and finds it beside itself, so "built" and "usable" are two states and this
# checks the second. It is not a compiler and nothing links it - the Language
# menu's two Convert items run it over the open file.
# cxx1 joined in 3.0, found the same way and for the same reason. 3.5 docks
# the VM6747 line instead - c90.exe and cpp11.exe, the same compilers with
# the TMS320C6747 as a fourth target, shalimar.exe the same Shalimar compiler with
# its three - and vm6747.exe, the emulator that runs the fourth target's
# programs, found beside the editor like the compilers. 4.0 adds masm.exe,
# the x86-64 assembler that stands in for ml64 when settings.json names it,
# and the two linkers: link.exe for x86-64, in place of Microsoft's, and
# lnk6x.exe for the C6000, in place of TI's, each when settings.json names it.
