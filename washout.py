"""Washout: a copy of RIDE and what it builds that holds what compiling needs, and nothing else.

    python3 washout.py DEST              copy RIDE's sources into DEST
    python3 washout.py DEST --workspace  and each project RIDE drives, beside it
    python3 washout.py DEST --force      replace DEST if it is already there

**What compiling needs, and no more** (2026-09-30): the sources - src/ and every
directory under it - the projects that build them - each compiler's ide/, and a
tool's own .vcxproj and .xcodeproj where it has no ide/ - and the headers those
projects compile against, lib/ and include/. Three more because the projects name
them: msvc/compat (the <unistd.h> MSVC lacks, for cc1 and cxx1), Shalimar's
runtime/ (its projects build the runtime from it) and, for RIDE, macos/ and
winforms/ (its two windows), product.props, and help/, projects/ and programs/,
which the macOS window's project copies into RIDE.app and cannot build without.
RIDE's projects/ and programs/ go as their sources (2026-10-02), the CCS
samples' .project, .cproject and .ccsproject with them, and the installers'
settings.json. **And the installer project of every target** (2026-10-05): packaging/ whole - Windows'
Installer.vcxproj with build-installer.bat, stage.cmd and the Inno script, the Xcode workspace's
Installer.xcodeproj with build-pkg.sh, Linux's build-run.sh and install-header.sh - with workspace.mk and each
project's Makefile, which the macOS and Linux installers build through, and docs/ and README.md, which every
installer ships. Nothing else goes: no test, seal or other script. A source directory keeps only
source and project files; ide/, lib/, include/, msvc/compat and packaging/ are whole.

What was measured: every path the solutions, projects and workspaces name was
listed and is here, and a copy builds - RIDE.sln on Windows, RIDE.xcworkspace and
each ide/ alone on the Mac. Binaries are dropped, the icons kept on purpose.
