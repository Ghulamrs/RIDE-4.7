@echo off
rem Remove everything RIDE and the nine projects it drives build on Windows, and
rem nothing they are made of. The Unix half of this is clean.sh; this is not a translation of it
rem because the two machines do not leave the same things behind.
rem
rem   clean.cmd        clean
rem   clean.cmd -n     say what would go, remove nothing
rem
rem Run it from the RIDE directory. The projects are expected beside it -
rem VM6747\ (Compiler-Ci, Compiler-Cppi, Compiler-Si, Emulator), Converter-C2S\,
rem ASM6x\, MASM\, LINK\ and LNK6x\ - which is what RIDE.sln's ..\ paths require.
rem
rem **Every path here is named, never globbed.** clean.sh can ask git whether a
rem path is source; there is no git on this machine, so the safety has to come
rem from the list itself. `Compiler-C\lib` is sixteen tracked header files and
rem `Compiler-S\lib` is built runtime archives - the same name one directory
rem apart, meaning opposite things - so nothing here removes a directory called
rem lib, and the MSVC build does not produce one at that level in any case.
rem
rem What MSVC leaves that the Makefiles do not: a per-project intermediate
rem directory named after the project (RIDEConsole\, cc1\, shc\, c2s\), the
rem x64\ output tree, and .obj/.pdb/.ilk beside whatever was built by hand.
