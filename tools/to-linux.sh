# Copies this tree and what it drives to the Linux box, builds the workspace
# there and runs every suite.
#
# Three reasons it is worth doing, and only the first is the obvious one.
#
# It is the third machine, and the editor claims to be one editor on all three.
# It is built with real g++ rather than Apple's clang, which is the only thing
# that can say whether the sources are ISO C++14 - Apple's libc++ hands you
# C++17 names under -std=c++14, so a C++17-ism compiles clean on a Mac and
# passes the host suite. And it is where a C++ group goes to g++ rather than to
# clang++ or cl, which is a routing this editor now makes and nowhere else can
# check.
#
# A tarball rather than that box's own clones, which is a deliberate choice
# and not an oversight. A clone can only ever have what has been pushed, and
# this script exists to check what is in the working tree *before* it is
# committed; and the VM6747 line has no remote at all, by its own rules.
#
# 3.5: the compilers are the VM6747 line, and they travel with the editor.
# Before this the script handed the suites ~/build-ws/cc1.exe, a three-target
# cc1 from 2026-08-26 that refuses `-arch tms6747` - so the session suite's
# emulated-target case would have failed there, not skipped, and the emulator
# had never been compiled by g++ at all. Now the four repositories are laid out
# on the box exactly as they are here, ../VM6747/<name> beside the editor,
# which is the one assumption workspace.mk makes, and it builds them the way it
# builds them on the Mac. The converter goes the same way, since ~/converter
# there is a clone and behind.
#
# Laid over rather than wiped: the box is a t3.nano and every object it can
# keep between runs is minutes it does not spend again. What is excluded by
# name is what was built here - a Mach-O object or binary that travels over is
# "newer" than its source there and reads as a broken toolchain, which is how
# the first run of this script failed. The editor's own directory is emptied
# of everything but obj/ for the same reason it always was: it is where the
# binaries land, and a stale one beside a fresh one is a directory nobody can
# read.
#
# Everything runs inside a memory cgroup, as Compiler-C's ./build does, because
# this box has 419 MB and an uncapped build once took it down to a hypervisor
# power cycle. A capped process dies alone.
#
#   ./tools/to-linux.sh              build the workspace and run every suite
