# Copies this tree to the Windows box and builds it there.
#
# That box was rebuilt on 2026-08-25 and everything below is about the machine
# as it is now: reached as `ssh windows`, its ssh shell is cmd.exe, and the
# projects are siblings under C:\Users\GRA\source - RIDE (4.0's own
# directory, so the sealed 3.5 tree in RIDE is left alone), VM6747,
# ASM6x, MASM, LINK, LNK6x, Converter-C2S - which is the shape RIDE.sln assumes when
# it names ..\VM6747\Compiler-Ci\ide\cc1.vcxproj and the rest.
#
# Three rules that each cost an hour before they were written down:
#
#   * A tarball, extracted by Windows' own tar. scp of a directory tree at a
#     time left files behind and nobody noticed; one archive is one thing to
#     check. macOS puts ._ AppleDouble files in the archive unless told not to.
#   * A .cmd file, scp'd over and run by its full path, with no `cmd /c` in
#     front of it. The ssh shell is already cmd, and a command line with quotes
#     in it loses one on the way; a script file has no such problem.
#   * The tree there has no git. What this copies is what is built; a stale
#     file on that side is a stale build with a green suite in front of it.
#
# cxx1 travels with the editor since 3.0. RIDE.sln builds it from
# ..\VM6747\Compiler-Cppi\ide\cxx1.vcxproj (the root copies moved to ide/ on 2026-09-30), written at
# the root of the C++ checkout here; the sources, headers, msvc\compat and
# that project go over together, laid over the tree there - never wiping it,
# since that directory also holds hand-run experiments that are not ours.
#
#   ./tools/to-windows.sh              build the solution and run both suites
#   ./tools/to-windows.sh build        the console editor only, no suites
