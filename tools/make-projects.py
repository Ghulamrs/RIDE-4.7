Three machines, three shapes, one idea: open one thing and get all four
programs, with the editor built after the three it drives.

    macOS    RIDE.xcworkspace          RIDE.exe, c90.exe, cpp11.exe, vm6747.exe, asm6x.exe, masm.exe, link.exe, lnk6x.exe, shalimar.exe, c2s.exe
    Windows  RIDE.sln                  RIDEConsole, RIDEGui, c90, cpp11, vm6747, asm6x, masm, link, lnk6x, shalimar, c2s
    Linux    workspace.mk                 make -f workspace.mk

Was make-xcodeproj.py while Xcode was all it wrote.

Three command line tools, built by clang++, from three separate repositories:

    RIDE  this editor         RIDE/Editor.xcodeproj
    cc1      the C compiler      ../VM6747/Compiler-Ci/ide/cc1.xcodeproj    (its own)
    cxx1     the C++ compiler    ../VM6747/Compiler-Cppi/ide/cxx1.xcodeproj (its own)
    shc      the Shalimar one    ../VM6747/Compiler-Si/ide/shc.xcodeproj    (its own)

Since 3.5 the compilers are the VM6747 line - ../VM6747/Compiler-Ci,
Compiler-Cppi and Compiler-Si, building c90, cpp11 and shalimar - and the
emulator beside them. The three originals stay sealed and are not opened by
anything written here.
    c2s      the converter       ../Converter-C2S/c2s.xcodeproj

cxx1 joined in 3.0. Its checkout is called C++ here and Compiler-Cpp on
GitHub and on the Windows box, which is the one place the name matters: the
solution names ..\Compiler-Cpp, and the Makefile's CXX1_DIR is overridable
for the Linux box, where it is ~/cxx1. cxx1 keeps its own IDE projects in
ide/ for its own use; the two written here at its root are the workspace's,
as shc's and c2s's are, and its release seal covers neither.

c2s is the odd one of the four: the editor runs it but does not compile with
it. It converts C89 to Shalimar and back, and the editor's Language menu has
two items that put it over the open file. It is in the group for the same
reason the compilers are - the editor looks for what it drives beside itself,
so all four have to be built into one place.

and RIDE.xcworkspace, which opens all four at once so that a change to a
compiler and the change to the editor that goes with it are one build and one
issue list.

**Each project is generated from that repository's own Makefile.** A hand-kept
project drifts: someone adds a file to the Makefile, forgets the project, and
Xcode quietly builds yesterday's program - which is not an error, just a
smaller program, so nothing says so. That has now happened twice here. Once
when sources were added and this was not re-run, and once when this script
stopped reading a Makefile variable that had been added to it. --check is the
answer to both: it rebuilds every project in memory and compares.

**Three projects are checked rather than written.** winforms/RIDEGui.vcxproj is
kept by hand, because what is in it besides the source list cannot be derived
from a Makefile: it compiles one file managed and every other file native. cc1's
and cxx1's are their own, in each compiler's ide/, written by its ide/generate.py
and asked with --check (2026-09-30; RIDE wrote copies into the compilers until
then). The window's source list is compared against the Makefile all the same - that is the part
that drifts, and the window's had drifted the whole time nobody was checking
it. --check also insists the Makefile is made of the variables named here and
no others, so adding one and forgetting this script fails loudly.

The identifiers are derived from the file names and the product, so
regenerating an unchanged project produces a byte-identical file and the
comparison is exact.

A project is written into the repository it belongs to, so its paths are
relative to that repository and mean something inside it. The workspace lives
here and reaches the other three with ../ - which is the one thing in this
that assumes all four are checked out side by side.

# Xcode's own template turns on warnings none of these three Makefiles uses -
# -Wshorten-64-to-32 among them - and with warnings as errors that makes the
# project refuse a program `make` builds without complaint. cc1 failed exactly
# that way the first time this workspace was tried.
#
# The point of generating these from the Makefiles is that Xcode builds what
# make builds. A project that is *stricter* than the build it mirrors diverges
# just as surely as one that is laxer; it simply fails instead of passing. So
# the Xcode-only extras are turned off and the flag set is the Makefile's:
# -Wall -Wextra -pedantic, as errors.
# And the intermediates go outside the checkout. With no SYMROOT an Xcode build
# lands in <project>/build, which is how RIDE came to hold 92 object files
# under a target name that had been renamed away months earlier - invisible to
# make clean, because it is not make's. $(TMPDIR) is per-user and Xcode expands
# it from the environment.
#
# A workspace build ignores SYMROOT in any case - the workspace arena wins, and
# that is how these products come to sit under DerivedData at a path nobody can
# type. Where they *end up* is the install phase's business, below; SYMROOT
# still decides where a build of one .xcodeproj on its own goes.
# MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is the lowest the installed Xcode accepts: 27.0
# refuses the 10.15 these once carried ("the range of supported deployment
# target versions is 12.0 to 27.0.x"), and so refused to build every project
# made here. The Makefiles name no minimum and build for the machine they run on.

# A Makefile's -D flags are as much a part of what it builds as its source
# list. cc1's CC1_INCLUDE_DIR is the one that matters here: it is the absolute
# path to the lib/ holding the fifteen headers cc1 ships, and Driver.cpp
# defaults it to "" when nobody defines it, so a project that forgets it builds
# a compiler that runs, parses, and then cannot find <stdio.h> - reporting an
# empty list of directories it looked in, which reads as a broken installation
# rather than a project missing one line. That is what the workspace produced
# from 2026-08-22 until 2026-08-27, and no build and no suite could see it,
# because both compilers are built by make everywhere the suites run.
#
# The doubled backslashes are one level of pbxproj escaping over one level of
# shell: what has to reach clang is -DCC1_INCLUDE_DIR="/some/path".
# Relative to each project rather than written out, because the four are only
# ever expected side by side - the same assumption workspace.mk and the
# solution already make - and an absolute path here would be one machine's.

# archive holds no debugger code at all, and the debug one is the same program

# about to be used missing.
#
# Two things here are not typos. cl will not create the directory /Fo names -
# it says so three files later as "Cannot open compiler generated file", which
# reads as a disk problem - so the object directories are made first. And the
# doubled backslash in /Fo is required: a single one before a closing quote
# escapes the quote, and cl then answers "D8003: missing source filename".
# Read from Compiler-S's Makefile rather than written down, for the reason
# every other list here is: a runtime file added there and forgotten here gives
# an archive missing one object, and the link that fails names a symbol rather
# than a file. RUNTIME_SOURCES is the release list; DEBUG_RUNTIME_SOURCES is
# that plus runtime/Debug.cpp, and the $(RUNTIME_SOURCES) it opens with holds

# archive that is not there. Windows got this on 2026-08-23 and the Xcode side
# did not, because --check compares which .cpp a project builds and a build
# phase is not a .cpp.
#
# $BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR is where shc.exe itself lands, and shc looks for lib/
# beside its own binary - so the archives go in without the editor, the
# workspace or shc knowing anything about each other.
#
# The flags are Compiler-S's CXXFLAGS and not Xcode's: what make builds is what
# this should build, and the runtime does not vary with the Debug/Release the
# *compiler* was built as. Both archives are written in either configuration,
# as `make all` writes both - a debug link takes the second, and shipping one
# would leave exactly the half about to be used missing.

# arm64-darwin because Compiler-S's Makefile says TARGET ?= arm64-darwin for
# any Darwin host, and the name has to be the one shc asks for.

# **The four programs are copied into RIDE's own directory when they are
# built.** That is the Mac half of one binary directory on every machine -
# `make -f workspace.mk` builds all four into $(CURDIR) there and RIDE.sln
# builds five into x64\\Release, while the workspace alone used to leave them
# under DerivedData. The editor finds what it drives with path::besideProgram
# before PATH, so this is also what makes a workspace-built RIDE.exe run the
# compilers it was built with rather than whichever ones are on the machine.
#
# **Copied, and not built there, and that is not the preference it looks
# like.** CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR does aim the link straight at this directory,
# and it was tried first: it works until you build Debug after Release without
# editing anything. Xcode plans a build before it runs it, decides the link is
# up to date because the *other* configuration's binary is newer than every
# input, and skips it - so the directory keeps the wrong build and says it
# succeeded. Clearing the product in a phase does not help, because the plan
# was already made: dsymutil then fails with `cannot parse the debug map ...
# No such file or directory` and the build ends with three of the four
# programs deleted. A copy has none of that in it. It always runs, it copies
# the configuration that was actually built, and a link Xcode skipped is a
# copy of a file that is already right.
#
# Debug and Release therefore land on each other here, as make's one build
# does: what stands in this directory is what you built last.
#
# `mv` over `cp` for the last step because the destination may be running -
# a rename replaces the directory entry and leaves the running image alone,
# where writing through it is "Text file busy".
#
# **And the copy is signed here, because Xcode signs a target after its script
# phases, not before.** A phase at the end of the list still runs before
# CodeSign, so what it has to copy is the linker's output - and the linker was
# given -no_adhoc_codesign precisely because Xcode meant to sign it later. On
# arm64 an unsigned Mach-O does not run at all: the copy would land, look
# right, and die with `Killed: 9`. First seen as a 22KB difference between the
# copy and the product, which is a signature's worth of hashes.
#
# Ad-hoc, as `-` says, which is what the linker does for a `make` build and
# what "Sign to Run Locally" means. The entitlements Xcode's own signature
# carries are not reproduced; they are for debugging the product in Xcode, and
# that is done in the build directory, not here.
