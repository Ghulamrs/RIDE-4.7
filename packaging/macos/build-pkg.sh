#   /Applications/RIDE <ver>.app   the AppKit window, with every tool it
#                               drives and their headers and runtime inside it
#   /usr/local/ride-<ver>/      the console editor and the same tools, laid
#                               out as the Windows install is: bin include
#                               lib help projects programs (projects/ccs: CCS samples)
#   /usr/local/bin/<tool>-<ver> symbolic links into /usr/local/ride-<ver>/bin,
#   /usr/local/bin/<tool>       and the plain names pointed at this version as
#                               the newest - all but link, which macOS already
#                               has as /usr/bin/link
#
# Its own package identifier, app name and directory: 4.7 installs beside
# 4.5 and 4.51 (com.ghulamrs.ride and ride451, their RIDE apps,
# /usr/local/ride and ride-4.51) and touches none of it but the plain
# command names, which now point here.
#
#   packaging/macos/build-pkg.sh [version]        -> dist/RIDE-<ver>-macos.pkg
#
# The tools are built for macOS 12, the window's own deployment target, into
# dist/mac/bin: the ones in bin/ carry the building Mac's version as their
# minimum and would refuse to start on anything older. Both halves find their
# headers the way a relocated install must - beside the program or one
# directory up - so nothing depends on where this tree was.
#
# Without a Developer ID the package cannot be signed or notarized: another
# Mac asks the user to open it from Finder's context menu the first time.
