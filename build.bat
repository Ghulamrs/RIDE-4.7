rem Builds WinConsole with MSVC, which is how it is built on the machine it is
rem meant for. There is no make on that box, and none is needed: a couple of
rem dozen translation units and one link.
rem
rem RIDEConsole.exe is this project's console editor on Windows.
rem On Windows RIDE.exe is the window - which is what somebody there runs -
rem and on a Mac or Linux, where there is no window, RIDE.exe is this one. - the same source as
rem ed1 on Linux and macOS, over the Windows half of the terminal, and named for
rem the machine it runs on so that the three variants can be told apart where
rem they are installed. See "The three variants" in the README.
rem
rem   build            builds RIDEConsole.exe
rem   build test       builds it, then builds and runs the unit tests
rem   build session    builds it, then drives the editor itself with keystrokes
rem   build check      both
rem
rem Run it from a Developer Command Prompt, or run it from anywhere and let it
rem find vcvars64 itself.
rem
rem The search is pinned to Visual Studio 2022 - the [17.0,18.0) below. A bare
rem "vswhere -latest" reaches past it to a newer Visual Studio if one is
rem installed, which is not the toolset this is built with.
rem
rem _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS is defined for the same reason cc1's own project
rem defines it: getenv and strerror are standard C++17, and MSVC's objection to
rem them is house policy rather than a defect to go and fix.
setlocal
rem The product's name, once, as product.props, the Makefile and the .iss spell it.
set "PRODUCT=RIDE"
set "PRODUCT_LOWER=ride"

rem Before anything is built, because this one only looks at files. It needs no
rem compiler and no Visual Studio environment, and a check that rebuilds the
rem editor before answering is a check nobody runs.

rem **Into bin\, which is where the compilers are.** This built the
rem console editor into the repository root until 2026-08-27, and an editor
rem there has nothing beside it: the solution puts c90.exe, shalimar.exe, c2s.exe
rem and shc's lib\ in bin\ (via /p:OutDir), and RIDE finds what it drives with
rem path::besideProgram before it looks at PATH. So a `build.bat` editor could
rem not compile anything without $CC1 being named, and said so in its own About
rem box - three times over, "not beside this program". The two ways of building
rem the editor here now write to the same directory, which is what make does on
rem Unix with BINDIR.
rem
rem The stale root copy goes with it. Two RIDEConsole.exe in one tree is a
rem tree where nobody can say which one they ran, and this one would be the
rem older every time from now on.

rem **All four programs into one directory.** cc1, shc, this editor's console
rem half and the window, with both editors depending on both compilers so a
rem change to one and the change to the editor that goes with it are a single
rem build. This is what workspace.mk is on Unix.
rem
rem They land in bin\ together, which is the whole point: the editor
rem finds the compilers it drives beside itself before it looks at PATH, so a
rem build that scatters them is a build you cannot run from. Two of the four
rem always landed there; cc1 did not, because cc1.vcxproj set OutDir to its own
rem project directory, and the window did not, because it was not in the
rem solution at all. Both fixed at the source rather than by copying afterwards
rem - see the comments in cc1.vcxproj and shc.vcxproj.
rem
rem Run from here rather than by calling msbuild directly, because msbuild is
rem on PATH only after vcvars64.bat - which the top of this file has already
rem found. One place knows where Visual Studio is.

rem 3.5 the compilers are the VM6747 line, c90, cpp11 and shalimar, with vm6747
rem the emulator that runs the fourth target - so all six are laid out beside each other
rem on this machine, as tools/to-windows.sh lays them.

:confirm
rem What the editor drives, and the check that it is actually there.
rem
rem The editor links against none of it. It *runs* these, and finds them beside
rem itself, so "built" and "usable" are two different states and nothing
rem checked the second until now. A shc.exe standing without its runtime
rem compiles, writes correct assembly and then dies at the link - which no
rem build and no suite could see, because -S needs no runtime. It waited for
rem somebody to press Run on a Shalimar file, and then read as a broken
rem compiler rather than an incomplete directory.
rem
rem c2s.exe is named too. The Makefile's confirm has always listed it and this
rem did not, so the Windows check was one binary weaker than the Unix one - and
rem the converter is exactly the kind of thing that goes missing, being the one
rem of the four that nothing links and only the Language menu runs.
rem
rem Both runtime archives are named. Debug is the editor's default
rem configuration and links the other one, so checking a single archive would
rem confirm exactly the half that was not about to be used. And the C6000
rem runtime, a directory of assembly cpp11 writes for shalimar's post-build step:
rem the Makefile's DEPENDENCIES has named it since 3.5 and this did not, so a
rem box with both archives and no directory confirmed clean while a Shalimar
rem program for the emulator had nothing to run beside.
